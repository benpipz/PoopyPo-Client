            , a community-driven initiative dedicated to keeping our streets
            clean and our neighborhoods beautiful. We're passionate about
            collecting dog poop from public spaces and sharing helpful
            information with each other. Together, we can create a cleaner,
            healthier environment for everyone. Join us in making a difference,
            one scoop at a time!
